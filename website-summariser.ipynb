      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century.\n",

      "Here's what happens:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\n",
      "2. **Scattering occurs**: These gas molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\n",
      "3. **Blue light is scattered**: The blue light is scattered in all directions by the gas molecules, reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky.\n",
      "4. **Red light continues straight**: Meanwhile, the longer wavelength red light is not scattered as much and continues to travel in a more direct path, reaching our eyes from the direction of the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scattering effect gives the sky its blue color during the daytime, especially when the sun is overhead. The amount of scattering also depends on the position of the observer, with more scattering occurring at shorter angles (i.e., when the sun is lower in the sky).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional factors that influence sky color:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Dust and water vapor**: Tiny particles in the atmosphere can scatter light, adding to the blue color. This effect is more pronounced during dust storms or near large bodies of water.\n",
      "* **Atmospheric conditions**: The scattering of light can be affected by atmospheric conditions such as pollution, humidity, and cloud cover.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny gas molecules in our atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths (like blue) being scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red).\n"
